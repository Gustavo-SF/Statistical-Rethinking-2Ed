    "**8M3** In parts of North America, ravens depende upon wolves for their food. This is because ravens are carnivorous but cannot usually kill or open carcasses of prey. Wolves however can and do kill and tear open animals, and they tolerate ravens co-feeding at their kills.

Do you think the biological interaction could be linear? Why or why not?\n",
